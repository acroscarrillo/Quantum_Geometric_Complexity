The following content is *automatically* generated based on the code's docstrings and so on. 

Ideally, here you could have a section where you explain your scientific work. For instance here's some random maths:

**The Cauchy-Schwarz Inequality**

$$\left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k b_k \right)^2 \leq \left( \sum_{k=1}^n a_k^2 \right) \left( \sum_{k=1}^n b_k^2 \right).$$

Next, some further useful functionalities.

# Welcome!
This toy documentation is ment to serve as a minimal working template for your scientific work. In particular, it is well suited for basic repositories which are structured around a `/src` folder containing all the heavy lifting code which numerical experiments (inside, say `/experiments`) use. Of course, you may do something else and still find these docs useful. Ideally, all scientific papers should be accompanied by a documentation page (like this one) for faster communication/understanding and reproduction/usage. Enjoy! 

It took me a while to figure this one out so I thought I might as well share it!

In particular, it is well suited for basic repositories which are structured around a /src folder containing all the heavy lifting code which numerical experiments (inside, say /experiments) use. Of course, you may do something else and still find these docs useful. Ideally, all scientific papers should be accompanied by a documentation page (like this one) for faster communication/understanding and reproduction/usage. Enjoy!
